## 🔬 Research Overview & Methodology

The **PlantCLR** framework addresses two critical bottlenecks in plant pathology: the high cost of expert data annotation and the poor generalization of models from lab-controlled environments to noisy, real-world fields.

### 🛠 The Two-Stage Learning Pipeline

Our methodology decouples representation learning from classification to ensure the model captures intrinsic biological features rather than background noise.

1. **Self-Supervised Pretraining (SimCLR-style):**
   - **Backbone:** ConvNeXt-Tiny encoder $f(\cdot)$ with 28.6M parameters
   - **Strategy:** Uses a stochastic augmentation pipeline to generate two correlated views of each plant leaf
   - **Objective:** Minimize the **NT-Xent (Normalized Temperature-scaled Cross Entropy)** loss to maximize agreement between augmented versions of the same image in latent space
   - **Training:** 100 epochs with AdamW optimizer, batch size 64, initial learning rate 3×10⁻⁴

2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning:**
   - The projection head is removed, and a linear classifier is attached to the pretrained backbone
   - Fine-tuned for 50 epochs with reduced learning rate (1×10⁻²)
   - This allows the model to achieve high accuracy even with significantly reduced labeled training data

</p>

### 📐 Mathematical Objective

To learn generalizable features, we optimize the **NT-Xent** loss function:

$$
\ell_{i,j} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_j) / \tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^{2N} \mathbb{1}_{[k \neq i]} \exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_k) / \tau)}
$$

*Where $\text{sim}(u, v)$ denotes cosine similarity and $\tau$ represents the temperature parameter (τ = 0.5).*

## 🔍 Interpretability & Visual Analysis

A critical requirement for agricultural deployment is ensuring the model identifies actual disease markers rather than background artifacts.

### ✅ Confusion Matrices

The confusion matrices confirm minimal inter-class leakage, even among visually similar symptoms (e.g., different types of leaf spots).

  <br>
  <em>Figure 5: Confusion matrix for Cassava Leaf dataset demonstrating 91.67% accuracy with balanced performance across all disease categories.</em>
</p>

### 🌀 Feature Space: t-SNE Visualization

Using t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), we visualize the high-dimensional latent space. Notice how the self-supervised pretraining forces distinct diseases into well-defined clusters before a single label is even seen.

  <br>
  <em>Figure 6: t-SNE visualization of learned representations showing clear disease cluster separation in the 768-dimensional feature space, reduced to 2D for visualization.</em>
</p>

**Key Observations:**
- Distinct, non-overlapping clusters for each disease category
- Healthy samples form tight, compact clusters
- Similar disease types show spatial proximity in feature space
- Self-supervised pretraining creates semantically meaningful embeddings

### 📈 Learning Dynamics: Accuracy & Loss

</p>

**Training Details:**
- Convergence achieved at epoch 87 for PlantVillage
- Final validation loss: 0.0234
- No significant overfitting observed (train-val gap < 1%)
- Early stopping patience: 15 epochs

### 🔦 Explainable AI: Grad-CAM Visualizations

We utilize **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** to generate heatmaps. This proves the model's "attention" is correctly localized on the necrotic tissue and leaf lesions, providing a biological basis for its decisions.

**PlantVillage Grad-CAM:**

  <em>Figure 8: Grad-CAM visualization for PlantVillage dataset. The model correctly focuses on disease-relevant regions: (a) bacterial spots, (b) leaf blight, (c) early blight lesions, and (d) powdery mildew symptoms.</em>

  <em>Figure 9: Grad-CAM visualization for Cassava Leaf dataset demonstrating attention on pathological markers: (a) brown streak lesions, (b) mosaic patterns, (c) bacterial blight symptoms, and (d) green mottle patterns.</em>
</p>

**Clinical Validation:**
- 94.7% of Grad-CAM activations co-localize with expert-annotated lesion regions
- Average IoU (Intersection over Union) with ground truth: 0.78
- Model attention aligns with phytopathological knowledge
